My PhD project at the University of Portsmouth investigates the risk that shipping poses to whales, dolphins and porpoises (cetaceans) in the north-east Atlantic. Broadly this is broken down into 1) the current state and change over time of shipping intensity; 2) the spatio-temporal co-occurrence of ships and cetaceans; 3) a deep dive into the risks faced by fin whales; 4) exploring the experience, knowledge and opinions of ship crews to the problem and potential mitigation solutions.
